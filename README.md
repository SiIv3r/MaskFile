## ![MaskFile Tool](imgmaskfile.png)

## What is MaskFile?
*Hide the true face of your files.* MaskFile disguises the extension of any file, making it appear as something it's not. A harmless image? Or something else? You'll never know until it's too late.

## Why Use It?
- Educate about the dangers of misleading file names. (lol)
- Test awareness in phishing simulations. (lol x2)
- Demonstrate how attackers exploit human trust. (lol x3)

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xdev9/MaskFile.git
cd MaskFile
```
3. Run the tool:
```bash
python maskfile.py
```

## Usage
1. Launch the program.
2. Browse and select the target file.
3. Choose the fake extension to apply (e.g., `jpg`, `txt`).

Example:
```bash
Enter the path of the file to disguise: /path/to/secret.pdf
Enter the fake extension to display (e.g., jpg, txt, pdf): jpg
[‚úÖ] Success: '/path/to/secret.pdf' has been disguised as '/path/to/secret.jpg'.
```

**For educational purposes only.** Do not use this tool for malicious activities. Be the guardian, not the threat.

Someone. Or no one.
